# Contributing to AL-Go

This section describes how to contribute to AL-Go. How to set up your own environment (your own set of actions and your own templates)

You can do this in two ways:
- Use a fork of AL-Go for GitHub in your own **personal GitHub account** in development mode
- Use 3 public repositories in your own **personal GitHub account** (AL-Go-PTE, AL-Go-AppSource and AL-Go-Actions, much like in production)

## Use a fork of AL-Go for GitHub in "development mode"

1. Fork the [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go) repository to your **personal GitHub account**.
2. You can optionally also create a branch in the AL-Go fork for the feature you are working on.

**https://github.com/<yourGitHubUserName>/AL-Go@<yourBranch>** can now be used as a template in your AL-Go project when running _Update AL-Go System Files_ to use the actions/workflows from this fork.

## Use 3 public repositories in "production mode"

1. Fork the [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go) repository to your **personal GitHub account**.
2. Navigate to [https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and create a new personal access token with **Full control of private repositories** and **workflow** permissions.
3. In your personal fork of AL-Go, create a New Repository Secret called **OrgPAT** with your personal access token as content. See **https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go/settings/secrets/actions**.
4. In your personal fork of AL-Go, navigate to **Actions**, select the **Deploy** workflow and choose **Run Workflow**.
5. Using the default settings press **Run workflow**. Select the AL-Go branch to run from and the branch to deploy to.

Now you should have 3 new public repositories:

- [https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-Actions](https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-Actions)
- [https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-AppSource](https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-AppSource)
- [https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-PTE)

> **Note:** Deploying to a branch called **preview** will only update the two template repositories (and use your AL-Go project with the current SHA as actions repository).

You can optionally also create a branch in the AL-Go fork for the feature you are working on and then select that branch when running Deploy (both as **Use workflow from** and as **Branch to deploy to**).

**yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-PTE@yourBranch** or **yourGitHubUserName/AL-Go-AppSource@yourBranch** can now be used in your AL project when running Update AL-Go System Files to use the actions/workflows from this area for your AL project.

Please ensure that all unit tests run and create a Pull Request against [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go). You are very welcome to run the end to end tests as well, but we will also run the end to end tests as part of the code review process.

> **Note**: You can also deploy to a different branch in the 3 public repositories by specifying a branch name under **Branch to deploy** to when running the **Deploy** workflow. The branch you specify in **Use workflow from** indicates which branch in **your personal fork of the AL-Go repository** you publish to the 3 repositories.

## Unit tests
The Tests folder, in the AL-Go repository, contains a number of unit-tests. Open Tests/runtests.ps1 in VS Code and select Run. Unit tests are quick and will run on every PR and every Push. We will be adding a lot of unit tests going forward.

## End to End tests
In the e2eTests folder, in the AL-Go repository, there are 3 types of end to end tests.
- Test-AL-Go.ps1 contains an end-2-end test scenario and is in E2E.yaml run for all combinations of Public/Private, Windows/Linux, Single/Multiproject and PTE/AppSource.
- Test-AL-Go-Upgrade.ps1 contains an end-2-end upgrade scenario and is run for all prior releases of AL-Go for GitHub to test that you can successfully upgrade that version to the latestand run CI/CD successfully.
- The scenarios folder contains a set of AL-Go scenarios, which tests specific functionality end to end. Every folder under e2eTests/scenarios, which contains a runtests.ps1 will be run as a scenario test, like:
  - UseProjectDependencies - create a repo with multiple projects and set **UseProjectDependencies** to modify CI/CD and other build workflows to build projects in the right order
  - GitHubPackages - create 3 repositories using GitHub Packages as dependency resolver and check that artifacts are built properly
  - BuildModes - create a repository, set buildModes and test that generated artifacts are as expected.
  - ReleaseBranches - testing that create release works, release branches are create and subsequently found correctly as previous build
  - SpecialCharacters - testing that various settings (+ publisher name and app name) can contain special national characters

In your personal fork, you can now run the end to end tests, if the following pre-requisites are available:
- You need the following secrets:
  - E2EPAT needs to be a Personal Access Token with these permissions: _admin:org, delete:packages, delete_repo, repo, workflow, write:packages_
  - AdminCenterApiCredentials needs to be the adminCenterApiCredentials as described [here](CreateOnlineDevEnv2.md).
  - LicenseFileUrl needs to be a direct download URL to a developer .bclicense file
  - InsiderSasToken needs to contain the Insider Sas Token from https://aka.ms/collaborate
- Beside the secrets, you need to have a GitHub organization setup, which will contain all the temporary repositories created by the end to end testing. This organization needs to have at least two instances of a GitHub runner registered as self-hosted (for running all private repo builds)

Run the End to end tests by running the *End to end tests* workflow and specify your organization in the corresponding field.
End to end testing will create a lot of repositories called tmpXYZ, where XYZ is a random letter combination. If End to end tests are failing, the tmp repositories are NOT removed, but can be used for troubleshooting.
You can run the *Cleanup after failed E2E* workflow to cleanup these repositories.

You can also run the end to end tests directly from VS Code, by providing the following global variables:

| Variable                          | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                           |

| $global:appSourceTemplate         | String       | URL for your PTE template (like `freddyk/AL-Go-AppSource@main` or `freddydk/AL-Go@main\|Templates/AppSource App` for using your AL-Go fork directly)  |
